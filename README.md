# recommend-service
Update: This was intended as the repo for the service layer, but due to the inate structure of next.js applications, it holds both the service layer and the user interface layer.


Purpose: service layer provides authentication, list management, social following, media retrieval, and recommendation feed endpoints for the Recommend application. It integrates with a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database and adheres to security and data access rules defined in our design documents.
